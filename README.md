# 🐱 Sorting Algorithms Explained by Cats

A fun way to learn sorting algorithms through cat emojis!
Each cat has a height (in cm) and a personality. Watch them organize themselves from shortest to tallest using different sorting algorithms!

## Features

- **5 Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort
- **Step-by-step mode**: Click through each comparison to understand what's happening
- **Auto-play**: Sit back and watch the cats sort themselves
- **Speed control**: From "very slow" for learning to "very fast" for fun
- **Beginner-friendly explanations**: No CS degree required!

## The Cast 🐱

- **Tiny** (40cm) - Our smallest kitty 😿
- **Grinny** (60cm) - Always smiling 😸
- **Kissy** (80cm) - Loves giving kisses 😽
- **Lovely** (100cm) - Full of love 😻
- **Smirky** (160cm) - Too cool for school 😼
- **Happy** (180cm) - Just happy to be here 😺
- **Shocked** (200cm) - Perpetually surprised 🙀
- **Laughy** (220cm) - Our tallest joker 😹

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click "Randomize Cats" to shuffle them
3. Pick a sorting algorithm from the left sidebar
4. Either:
   - Click "Next Step" to go through step-by-step

## The Algorithms Explained (Simply!)

**🫧 Bubble Sort**: Big cats slowly bubble to the right, like bubbles rising in soda

**👆 Selection Sort**: Find the smallest cat, put them first. Repeat.

**📥 Insertion Sort**: Take each cat and insert them in the right spot among the sorted ones

**🤝 Merge Sort**: Split cats into groups, sort each group, then merge them back together

**⚡ Quick Sort**: Pick a "captain" cat, everyone shorter goes left, taller goes right
